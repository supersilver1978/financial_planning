**First things first:**
- **[Install and run JupyterLab:](https://jupyter.org/install)**
Once JupyterLab is installed and you have run it from the terminal, check the version of Python within JupyterLab:
- In a block of code, Import library sys, then type sys.version, you will get your Python version in the output after running the block of code ![Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 02 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229381333-d8103f06-af51-4b08-b850-51a0b931a598.png)
**Now to clone this repository so you can open it up in JupyterLab:**
- **1:** Copy URL of this repo <img width="350" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 18 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382137-a8e0a113-8701-4388-8d8b-c6bcc88fa34b.png">
- **2:** Create a folder where you will clone this repo. As an example I created a folder 'Crypto_Arbitrage' on my desktop <img width="100" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 21 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382212-29caead6-2e93-4335-bc47-c4995fabba26.png">
- **3:** Clone the repo into the newly created folder using the copied URL of the repo in the terminal using 'git clone' <img width="550" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 19 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382255-4e82b266-f0bd-4872-ae40-3190d99e176c.png">
- **4:** Make sure you are in the directory where you cloned the repo, then type jupyter-lab in the terminal and hit enter <img width="255" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 24 36 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382330-e2d330da-f774-4954-a564-ad0654d0ae8f.png">
- **5:** It make take a sec or two for the JupyterLab server to open, but once it does you should have something that looks like this ![Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 27 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382435-8bc69a47-58c2-4454-a283-65f1fce3a3cf.png)
**Note:** Once you have JupyterLab running, your terminal will look like this and you won't be able to use it. Don't delete it, if you want to use the terminal you can open another new window. The JupyterLab terminal you shouldn't delete will look something like this: ![Screenshot 2023-04-02 at 3 30 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123714457/229382566-9c3cc3a8-b256-4481-bb1d-4d2c4c773026.png)
