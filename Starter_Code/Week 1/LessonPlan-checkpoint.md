# Module 1: Virtual Class I Lesson Plan (2 hours)

## Instructor Preparation

### What Are Virtual Class Sessions?

Virtual class sessions are held twice each week and are required for students. The primary goals of virtual sessions include the following:

* Build community.

* Help students who are stuck on the asynchronous work.

* Provide extra context in the learning journey, like remedial practice and career prep.

All virtual classes in the boot camp should include 30 minutes for office hours before the class begins. This time is not included on the time tracker, but the instructional team is expected to be on Zoom for office hours 30 minutes before the official class start time to assist with any issues, either in groups or one-on-one. Encourage students to attend office hours to get support, share ideas, and foster community-building in the class. Expect that students may ask for assistance with the following:

* Challenge assignment
* Further review of a particular subject
* Debugging assistance
* Help with computer issues
* Guidance with a particular tool

You can use the [Gallery View](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4403190845069-Getting-Started-with-Smart-Gallery-View) in Zoom to conduct office hours to see your class on one screen and ask for open questions. If particular topics need to be covered by different students, you can create [Zoom Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-breakout-rooms), and you and the TAs can join the groups to support students.

**Note:** Usually, office hours are not recorded, but if the session is being recorded to the cloud, only the main room will be recorded. However, if the class is being recorded locally, it will record whichever room the host is in. Keep this in mind when having private conversations with your instructional team.

The lesson plan below includes a rough time estimate for each section. Feel free to adjust the timing as you get to know the students and their needs. If time remains at the end of class, after you've done the planned activities, you can provide optional office hours for students who need additional support. Students who do not need extra assistance can log off. You will not hold any office hours at the beginning of the class this week. Instead, dedicate the time to conduct a "Welcome and Introductions" session; activity 1-4.

### Preparing for Your First Virtual Class Session
In the first session, it's important to create a positive learning environment that fosters community and establishes you as an expert. Taking the following steps on day one will help set you and your students up for success:

1. Review the activities and prepare your plan.

2. On the morning of the first session, post a friendly message that you're looking forward to class. Share the class agenda on your specific #01-live Slack channel, and invite students to submit questions ahead of time.

3. Log in to the session at the class time by going to your course in Canvas, clicking Zoom, and then clicking the meeting link.

4. [Here is a link to Blended New Start Experience Pilot First Virtual Class Introduction Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4StM9-GoEeiOyKuPGEJ9GTBLxG17570eeQzO5a3fh0/edit?usp=sharing). You will use these slides for activity 1-4, to Welcome and Introduce students to the class.

>Before class, consider customizing the slides with a picture or personal fact that reveals who you are as a person, not just an instructor. This can be anything from a cooking project to a picture of a pet. You can get creative.

    Don’t underestimate the importance of building community in your cohort! There are many different approaches to community building; you’ll see a few options in this lesson plan for how to start this important work. Select the option that best aligns with the size of your cohort, the time available for the networking activity, and your personal preference. Depending on which networking activity you choose, set up Zoom polls or randomized breakout rooms of 2-3 students in advance of class. Alternatively, have a TA set this up. Review “Polling for Zoom Meetings and Webinars,” “Managing =Breakout Rooms,” or “Using annotation tools for collaboration” for more information on how to use the Zoom functionalities described in this lesson plan. If you opt for the full group discussion activity, consider creating a randomized list of student names in advance. You can quickly generate a randomized list in Google Sheets. List each student’s name in the sheet, one per cell. Then highlight those cells, right click, and choose “More Cell Actions.” Then select “Randomize Range". Review the activities and prepare your plan.

## Overview
The goal of this first session is to build excitement for the boot camp curriculum, comfort with the required tools and getting to know the instructional team and peers.

* In the first section of class, focus on establishing a rapport and building engagement. Check that students are comfortable accessing the async content in Canvas as well as the associated activity files. Finally, review how to open Python files in VS Code and run them in Terminal or Git Bash.

* The middle section of the class will focus on the async material, specifically, variables and conditional statements.

* The final section of class time will be devoted to dev environment troubleshooting and optional office hours for students who need additional support.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the session, learners will be able to do the following:

* Students will get to know their instructional team and peers.

* Navigate Canvas and VS Code to access the async activity files.

* Use Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) to run Python script files.

* Declare, assign, and call Python variables.

* Identify the similarities and differences between lists and dictionaries.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome & Introductions (10 min)
This section of the first virtual class is your initial opportunity to meet your students and for your students to meet each other. Building community within your cohort is an ongoing process that will help your students feel supported and connected to the instructional team and their peers. Community and connectedness set the stage for social learning and openness to feedback throughout the boot camp. The more comfortable your students feel, the more likely they are to take academic risks and engage in class discussions.

   * Welcome the students to the boot camp. Convey your excitement for this first class and the journey your cohort will go on together.Provide a high-level overview of what will be covered in the boot camp and highlight any topics that you’re particularly excited about.Emphasize that students will learn a lot and practice many different skills over the next few months.

   * Instructor Introduction: Explain that you’ll spend the first part of class on introductions. Introduce yourself and share a brief summary of your industry and teaching backgrounds.

  * Optional: Share a little bit about your hobbies or interests outside of the boot camp content. Feel free to update Slides with personalized information, a photo, etc.

  * Other Introductions: Invite other members of the instructional and student support teams to introduce themselves.If any university partners are present, invite them to introduce themselves as well.
  ---

### 2. Student Do: Introductions (10 minutes)
  * Student Introductions: Explain that throughout the boot camp, they will work together in class and on group projects; they’ll have many opportunities to get to know one another and collaborate throughout the boot camp.

  * To kick off this first class, they’ll make first introductions. Invite students to introduce themselves by sharing their name, pronouns, where they live, and something that they want the class to know about them. Depending on the size of the cohort, you may choose to have students introduce themselves in breakout rooms instead of in the full group.

  * Optional: If you use breakout rooms for introductions, have one student from each breakout room share back with the full group. Depending on the size of the cohort, you may also invite students to share why they decided to enroll in this boot camp or how they hope to advance their career with the skills they acquire in the boot camp.

  * Optional: Invite students to send you a direct Slack message if there are things that they want you to know about that they don’t want to share with the class.

---
### 3. Class/Student Do: Networking Activity (10 min)

  Select the option that best suits your needs based on the size of your cohort, available time, and your facilitation preferences.
  * Option 1: Full-Class Poll: Best for large classes, timing is flexible, requires more instructor facilitation than other activities.Explain that one way you’ll collect their input throughout the course is through Zoom’s polling feature. They’ll practice using this feature as part of this activity. Read each question aloud, launch the poll, and invite students to respond. Share the results and comment on what you notice about trends and/or your own preferences before moving on to the next question. Repeat as time allows. If you have additional time, consider asking students to elaborate on their responses by coming off mute or sharing in the Slack channel.

  * Option 2: Breakout Room Discussions: Class size and timing is flexible, requires less instructor facilitation than other activities.Explain that throughout the boot camp students will work in small group breakout rooms. They’ll meet some of their peers in breakout rooms during this activity.Share the discussion questions with students and explain that in their breakout rooms, they should share their name and then select one question to answer. Once all students have shared, students can discuss the questions as a group. Tell students that they will have three minutes for their discussions and that you and/or the TA may visit different breakout rooms during the activity.Open breakout rooms (two to three students each) and set a timer for three minutes. After three minutes, close the breakout rooms. If time allows, reshuffle the breakout room assignments and invite students to participate in a different breakout room discussion using the second set of questions. Optional: Have one student from each breakout room share back with the full group.

  * Option 3: Full-Group Discussion: Best for small classes and a longer amount of time, requires more instructor facilitation than the previous activities. Explain to students that you look forward to all of their participation throughout the boot camp. Note that students can participate in discussion by unmuting their mic or through the class Slack channel. Emphasize that for this activity, you will call on students randomly. Note that when you call on a student, they can choose which question to answer. Provide students with a minute to review the slide and identify the question they would like to answer; this will help students  be more present while their peers are sharing. Encourage students to note any points of connection  in the Slack channel as their peers share. Using a randomized list, call on students one at a time to share their answers. Make sure that you invite each student to contribute.

  * Option 4: Full-Class Annotate Activity: Best for large classes and limited time, requires more instructor engagement than other activities. Explain that another Zoom function they might use during the boot camp is the annotation tool. Direct students to locate the annotation tool, then to select stamp and the star icon. Explain that students can contribute to annotations by clicking anywhere on the shared slide. Invite them to practice by adding a star on the slide. Invite students to annotate the shared slides to answer each question. Note any trends and/or share any connections you make to students. As time allows, invite students to share more details about what they annotated by unmuting their mic or responding in the Slack channel.

When you’ve completed the activity: Thank students for their participation and explain that they will have many more opportunities throughout the boot camp to collaborate and get to know their peers and transition to the activities of the lesson.

### 4. Instructor Do: You and Fintech (10 min)

In this part of the lesson, focus on the following:

* Build credibility and expertise. Start the session by discussing your background, your professional journey, tools from the curriculum that you work with, and cool accomplishments or projects that you’ve completed.

* Excite students about the fintech industry. Set the industry context. You could discuss the growth of the industry, key players, emerging trends, etc.

* Settle nerves. Students are typically worried about whether they fit in, so establishing the big picture is helpful.

* Engage students in discussion whenever possible.

* Consider starting an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session.

---

### 5. Instructor Do: Introduction to Python (10 min)

Explain that today students will take the exciting first step toward automating their work with Python!

Introduce Python by covering the following points:

* Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language used to create applications as well as solve smaller, individual development needs.

* Python has been used to build robust applications and analytic pipelines for a wide range of computing needs.

* In the financial industry, Python has been used to solve both simple mathematical equations, like calculating the future value of an investment, and complex quantitative problems, like sophisticated financial modeling, algorithmic trading and decision-making, and iterative and recursive data processing.

* Python can help automate work that's commonly done manually with spreadsheets, like data cleaning, data manipulation, and repetitive calculations.

Review the following advantages of using Python:

* Python supports disparate data formats, from spreadsheets and text to CSV, JSON, and XML files.

* Python integrates with database systems (e.g., Oracle, MySQL), providing a mechanism to load and extract large amounts of data.

* Python also has libraries and functions, such as NumPy and Pandas, that were developed specifically to help create financial applications and support data visualization.

* Python allows us to visualize data elements and their complexity and relationships. This capability is especially valuable for financial algorithms that require trend or time analysis.

On Slack, send students the link to this [FinanceTrain article on the best Python libraries and packages](https://financetrain.com/best-python-librariespackages-finance-financial-data-scientists/). Tell them that it's a great resource for more information about fintech-related Python libraries.

### 6. Instructor Do: Variables (10 min)

In this section, students will learn how to use variables in Python to perform value assignment and store and recall data.

**File:**

[variables.py](Activities/01_Ins_Variables/Solved/variables.py)

Start the class by opening the [variables.py](Activities/01_Ins_Variables/Solved/variables.py) Python file.

> **Important:** As you work through this first lesson, ensure that students understand the relationship between opening the activity files in VS Code and running the programs in a separate instance of Terminal or Git Bash.

Be sure to activate your conda dev environment for the students.

The transition from introducing Python to coding with Python:

> "Now that we know a bit about what Python is, it's time to start using it!"

At this point, students might feel apprehensive about the upcoming coding activities. Build confidence by saying something like the following:

> "This can be a really exciting experience, but it can also be very intimidating. Both of these feelings are understandable, but don't worry. If you think about it, computers themselves aren't smart, but they are logical. You get to tell them what to do and how to do it. That includes what computers are expected to remember—that information is held in a container called a variable."

* **Variables** are one of the key components of programming languages and serve as the primary means of data storage. They hold a reference to a data point, and they do so using a name that humans can understand.

Provide high-level context around the following examples of variables:

```python
company_abc_stock_price = 15.75
first_name = "Susan"
favorite_movies = ["Finding Nemo", "The Matrix", "Black Panther"]
```

* One way to think about variables is from the perspective of Excel. Highlight the following points:

  * Each cell label in Excel serves as a variable (e.g., A1, B1, C1).

  * Each cell has a name (e.g., A1), a value (e.g., 5), and a type (integer).

* Variables make data easier to understand and use in code because we can choose a name that makes sense.

Review the following block of code with students:

```python
# Creates a variable with a string "Frankfurter"
company_name = "Frankfurter Finance"
years_in_business = 23
hourly_wage = 65.40
expert_status = True

# Print the variables
print(company_name)
print(years_in_business)
print(hourly_wage)
print(expert_status)

# Prints the data type of each declared variable
print("The data type of variable title is", type(company_name))
print("The data type of variable years is", type(years_in_business))
print("The data type of variable hourly_wage is", type(hourly_wage))
print("The data type of variable expert_status is", type(expert_status))
```

Highlight the following main points about the preceding code block:

* Variables have three main operations: create, put, and retrieve.

  * To create a variable, **declare** it.

  * To put value on a variable, **assign** it.

  * To retrieve the value of a variable, **call** it.

* Compare the relationship between a variable and a value to an envelope and a letter: the envelope is the variable, and the value is the letter or its contents. **Calling** a variable is like opening an envelope and withdrawing the contents.

* All variables have a **data type**.

* Data types correspond to the type of data being stored, e.g., letters and words, phrases, or numbers.

* You can use variables to store fundamental types of data like strings of characters, numbers, and Boolean (true or false) values. You'll frequently encounter the following five standard Python data types:

  * **Number:** either integers or numbers with decimal points called floats

  * **String:** a group of letters defined by a set of quotation marks

  * **List:** a collection of multiple elements ordered by their index position

  * **Dictionary:** a collection of multiple elements defined by key-value pairs

  * **Boolean:** a value or expression that equates to `True` or `False`

* An advantage of storing data as variables is that they can be referred to by name in later parts of the code—for example, when you use them to perform mathematical calculations, like in the following example:

  ```python
  # Using variable names in calculations
  total_miles = 257
  gallons_gas = 7.2
  miles_per_gallon = total_miles / gallons_gas

  # Updating variables using assignment
  miles = 48
  kilometers = 0.621371 * miles

  # Substituting/formatting variable
  message = f"The total kilometers driven was: {kilometers}"
  print(message)
  ```

* The `+` operator plays two roles with python variables. With numerical values, it executes a simple addition. But it can also be used with string variables, which is called **concatenation**. You can see concatenation in action in the following example:

    ```python
    # Two number values will be added
    transaction_1 = 11.75
    transaction_2 = 14.99

    total_transaction_cost = transaction_1 + transaction_2
    print(total_transaction_cost)

    # Two string value will be concatenated
    last_name = "Jones"

    full_name = first_name + last_name
    print(full_name)
    print('My name is ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name + '.')
    ```

* Note that adding a currency identifier like `$` to a numerical value will change the data type from a number to a string. You'll no longer be able to perform addition; instead, the figure will be concatenated.

Take a moment to discuss the following best practices for naming variables:

* Variable names should be descriptive.

* Avoid acronyms or abbreviations.

* In Python, it's conventional to use [snake case](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), where each word is separated by an underscore.

Review the following good and bad examples of variable names:

  ```python
  # Bad Example
  mpg = 24
  # Better Example
  miles_per_gallon = 24
  ```

Explain to students that good variable names can greatly increase the readability of Python code.

Send a link to the [PEP 8 documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Encourage students to refer to this documentation to improve the readability and overall quality of their code.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 7. Student Do: Percent Increase (10 min)

Depending on how far along students are in the async material, this section might be a review.

**Files:**

[Starter file](Activities/02_Stu_Percent_Increase/Unsolved/percent_increase.py)

[Instructions](Activities/02_Stu_Percent_Increase/README.md)

In this activity, students will learn how to perform calculations and operations using variables. Students will find the percent increase of Apple stock and will complete coding drills.

If students need additional assistance or finish early, direct them to the Python style guide, which can be found here.

---

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Percent Increase PY (10 min)

**File:**

[Solution file](Activities/02_Stu_Percent_Increase/Solved/percent_increase.py)

Review the solution to the variables activity, highlighting the following points:

* Declaring variables requires a variable name and a value. The three attributes of a variable are the name, value, and data type.

* Variables can be assigned values derived from the calculation of other variables.

* Data types are implicitly understood in Python. This means that users don't have to specify the data type for a variable; they only have to assign the value. The Python interpreter receives the value, evaluates it internally, and determines what data type it is.

* Storing a numeric value as a variable with a percent sign or dollar sign changes the type to a string, which also eliminates the ability to use numerical functions (`sum()`, `avg()`, etc.).

Engage students with the following review questions:

* How do you create a variable?

  **Answer:** Declare it.

* How do you put a value on a variable?

  **Answer:** Assign it.

* How do you retrieve a value from a variable?

  **Answer:** Call it.

* What are the three attributes of a variable?

  **Answer:** Name, type, and value.

* What are some data types that we've covered so far?

  **Answer:** String, integer, Boolean, float.

* What is the function to display output to the screen?

  **Answer:** `print()`

* How do you determine the data type of a variable?

  **Answer:** `type()`

* What is the term for when two strings are added together?

  **Answer:** Concatenation.

Answer any additional questions about variables before moving on.

---

### 9. Instructor Do: Python Lists (10 min)

In this section, you'll introduce students to the concepts of Python lists, a heterogeneous collection of ordered data elements.

**File:**

[lists.py](Activities/03_Ins_Lists/Solved/lists.py)

Start with the following explanation:

> "In this next section, we'll work with more complex versions of the variable. The values assigned to these variables will each contain multiple elements. We'll use lists to handle this complex data. Python lists are prevalent in the world of fintech."

Using the [lists.py](Activities/03_Ins_Lists/Solved/lists.py) file, highlight the following information about Python lists:

* A list in Python is a collection of ordered elements or values, separated by commas, with an index of 0 for the first element. A list tends to resemble the following example:

  ```python
  # Index: 0 = "green", 1 = "blue", 2 = "red", 3 = "purple"
  color_hats = ["green", "blue", "red", "purple"]
  ```

* As shown in the following example, lists commonly hold values of the same data type as well as different data types—even other lists:

  ```python
  my_favorite_things = ["Chocolate", 9, ["beach", "mountains"], "breakfast_tacos"]
  ```

Demonstrate the use of lists by creating a list object called `where_we_live`. Ask students to post their hometowns in the class Slack channel.

**Note:** A TA can help consolidate the students' hometowns into a list. Tell students that they must post their hometown in the format of a string (e.g., `"Tyler, TX"`).

This is an opportunity for the instructional team to get to know the students better! Use the following example as a guideline for the process, but have students supply the data:

```python
print("We are a diverse group and come from everywhere...")
where_we_live = ["San Francisco, CA", "Conway, AR", "Orlando, FL", "Buffalo, NY", "Chicago, IL", "Edison, NJ", "Avondale, PA"]
print(where_we_live)
print()
```

Post the list in the Slack channel once you've created it.

Highlight that elements in a list are **ordered** by their **index position**. The first element in the list occupies index position 0, the second element occupies index position 1, and so on. Explain that you can access the element by referring to the list name and the index position inside square brackets.

Demonstrate that each element in the list can be accessed by its index.

Once the list `where_we_live` has been shared on Slack, ask the students to post the index of their hometown.

Make sure that students start counting the list indices from 0.

Explain the following code for an example:

```python
# Print element at index 2
print("My hometown is at index...")
print(where_we_live[2])
```

Here's the output:

```text
My hometown is at index...
Orlando, FL
```

* **Slice notation** allows us to specify particular elements from a list. The syntax `[start:end]` slices from the starting index to the ending index exclusively. Stress that the ending index is NOT included in the result.

Be sure to explain that any of these elements that we're accessing can be assigned to their own variable for access later on.

Use the following example of slice notation:

```python
# Set elements from index 2 to index 5 equal to some_of_our_places variable and print
print("We can access a portion of the list with a slice...")
some_of_our_places = where_we_live[2:5]
print(some_of_our_places)
print()
```

Here's the output:

```text
We can access a portion of the list with a slice...
["Orlando, FL", "Buffalo, NY", "Chicago, IL"]
```

Use `[start:end:step]` slice notation to specify the optional step parameter that defines the increment sizes, as shown in the following example:

```python
# Print every other element
print("Printing every other city")
every_other_city = where_we_live[::2]
print(every_other_city)
```

Here's the output:

```text
Printing every other city
["San Francisco, CA" , "Orlando, FL" , "Chicago, IL" , "Avondale, PA"]
```

The index `-1` can be used to target the last element of a list, as shown in the following example:

```python
# Print the last element of the list
print("The last city is...")
last_city = where_we_live[-1]
print(last_city)
```

Here's the output:

```text
The last city is...
"Avondale, PA"
```

You can modify a particular element in the list by targeting the element at its specified index and reassigning the value, as shown in the following example:

```python
# Change a specified element within the list at the given index
print("Change the first element in the list...")
where_we_live[0] = "Las Vegas, NV"
print(where_we_live)
```

Here's the output:

```text
Change the first element in the list...
["Las Vegas, NV", "Conway, AR", "Orlando, FL", "Buffalo, NY", "Chicago, IL", "Edison, NJ", "Avondale, PA"]
```

Python has a whole series of **operations** that can be used on the data in a list:

* The `append()` function adds elements to the end of a list, as shown in the following example:

  ```python
  # Add an element to the end of the list
  print("Adding a new place to the end of the list...")
  where_we_live.append("Honolulu, HI")
  print(where_we_live)
  ```

  Here's the output:

  ```text
  Adding a new place to the end of the list...
  ["Las Vegas, NV", "Conway, AR", "Orlando, FL", "Buffalo, NY", "Chicago, IL", "Edison, NJ", "Avondale, PA","Honolulu, HI"]
  ```

* The `len()` function determines how many elements are in the list, as shown in the following example:

  ```python
  # Calculate the number of elements within the list
  print("Calculating the number of places...")
  print(len(where_we_live))
  ```

  Here's the output:

  ```text
  Calculating the number of places...
  8
  ```

* We can use additional operations, like `min()`, `max()`, and `avg()`, on lists that contain numerical values.

On Slack, send students the link to this [guide to Python list methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list), for future reference.

Reiterate that lists are a powerful data container in Python and that it's important to be comfortable working with them.

### 10. Student Do: List Manipulation (10 min)

The following activity will allow students to practice accessing elements from lists and manipulating lists. Send the starter file and instructions to the students on Slack.

**Files:**

[Instructions](Activities/04_Stu_Manipulating_Lists/README.md)

[Starter Code](Activities/04_Stu_Manipulating_Lists/Unsolved/manipulating_lists.py)

**Instructions:**

Knowing how to access list elements and manipulate lists will be critical to your success in this module as well as the Challenge lesson.

In this activity, you'll get additional practice doing both.

Using the starter file and the `stock_tickers` list, update, add, and remove elements according to the specified instructions. After each action, print the list to confirm that your syntax was correct.

Use the [guide to Python list methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list) shared previously if you have any questions about some of the following list operations:

```python
stock_tickers = ['AMZN', 'CSCO', 'FB', 'GOOG','INTC', 'MSFT', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'WRK']
```

* Update the ticker `'WRK'` to `'WORK'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Add the ticker `'ZM'` to the end of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Add the ticker `'AAPL'` to the beginning of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Add the ticker `'DELL'` so it appears between `'CSCO'` and `'FB'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Remove the ticker `'INTC'` from the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Remove the ticker `'SQ'` from the list using the `pop()` method. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

* Slice a section of the list that includes the tickers `'CSCO'`, `'DELL'`, `'FB'`, and `'GOOG'`. Set this equal to a variable called `stock_tickers_slice`. Print the new variable to confirm your code.

### 11. Instructor Do: Review List Practice (10 min)

**File:**

[Solution file](Activities/04_Stu_Manipulating_Lists/Solved/manipulating_lists.py)

Use the solution file to review the list manipulation activity with students.

In addition to reviewing the code snippets, engage students with the following review questions:

* What is the syntax that defines a list?

  **Answer:** Square brackets, with commas between each element.

* What is the index position of the first element in a list?

  **Answer:** 0

* What is the shortcut syntax to access the last element in a list?

  **Answer:** `-1`

* What is the list method for adding an element to the end of a list?

  **Answer:** `append()`

* When using slice syntax, is the element specified by the ending number included in the slice?

  **Answer:** No, the ending index specified is NOT included in the slice.

* Can a list include another list as an element?

  **Answer:** Yes, it can. This is an example of a **nested** list.

Answer any additional student questions about lists before moving on.

### 13. Instructor Do: Python Dictionaries (10 min)

In this section of the class, you'll introduce students to Python dictionaries.

**File:**

[dicts.py](Activities/05_Ins_Dictionaries/Solved/dicts.py)

Using the [dicts.py](Activities/05_Ins_Dictionaries/Solved/dicts.py) file, explain the following basic points about dictionaries:

* **Dictionaries**, or **dicts**, are like lists in that they're a collection of elements that are each separated by commas.

* Dictionaries, however, store values using a special label called a **key**. When you provide the key to a dictionary, you receive the **value** that belongs to that key.

* Dicts operate just like physical, language dictionaries: if you know the word, you can find the definition. The word is the key, and the value is the definition.

To demonstrate the relationship between keys and values, live-code the following example of declaring a dictionary:

```python
# Initialize a dictionary containing top traders for each month in 2019
top_traders_2019 = {
    "january" : "Karen",
    "february" : "Harold",
    "march" : "Sam"
}

print()
print(f"Dictionary: {top_traders_2019}")
print()
```

As you live-code, explain the following points:

* The dictionary will contain the top traders for each month in 2019.

* The month will be the key, and the name of the trader will be the value.

Briefly discuss the differences between dictionaries and lists and when one should be used instead of the other, as follows:

* While dictionaries and lists are both data containers in Python, they behave quite differently. Lists store items in a specific order; dictionaries store items in an unordered way, using keys.

* Searching for values in dictionaries is significantly faster than looking for values in lists, for the following reasons:

  * It will always take the same amount of time to search for a value in a dictionary, even if the dictionary increases in size.

  * Size drastically slows down performance when searching a list; if a list doubles in size, search time could also double.

Before starting the demonstration, pose the following scenario:

* Imagine that you're prepping for a promotion to a senior trader. You're 95% confident the promotion is yours, but you want to find one more way to add value to the firm.

* You come up with the idea to use Python to automate a process that you, your manager, and your coworkers spend countless hours doing each day—storing and tracking profits and losses.

* So far, you've coded a good majority of the logic needed for this program. You've been using lists to store profits and losses every day, but you've heard that dictionaries have better search performance.

* You don't know much about dictionaries, but you want your manager to see that you're innovative and that you know how to create optimized Python programs!

Open the solution file and demonstrate the syntax for creating a dictionary to store daily trading profits and losses, as follows:

* Dictionaries are syntactically defined via `{}`, or curly braces, with key-value pairs separated by colons, `:`.

* Dictionaries allow for heterogeneous data (varying data types). In the following example, the `trading_pnl` dictionary holds both strings and integers:

  ```python
  # Initialize a dictionary
  trading_pnl = {
      "title": "Trading Log",
      "03-18-2019": -224,
      "03-19-2019": 352,
      "03-20-2019": 252,
      "03-21-2019": 354,
      "03-22-2019": -544,
      "03-23-2019": -650,
      "03-24-2019": 56,
      "03-25-2019": 123,
      "03-26-2019": -43,
      "03-27-2019": 254,
      "03-28-2019": 325,
      "03-29-2019": -123,
      "03-30-2019": 47,
      "03-31-2019": 321,
      "04-01-2019": 123,
      "04-02-2019": 133,
      "04-03-2019": -151,
      "04-04-2019": 613,
      "04-05-2019": 232,
      "04-06-2019": -311
  }
  ```

* Print out the entire dictionary, as follows:

  ```python
  print(f"Dictionary: {trading_pnl}")
  print()
  ```

* Specific values from a dictionary can be called via the associated key, as follows:

  ```python
  # Print out specific value of a key
  print(f"03-31-2019: {trading_pnl['03-31-2019']}")
  print()
  ```

* To add a new key-value pair to a dictionary, simply specify a new key-value pair combination, like in the following example:

  ```python
  # Add a new key-value pair
  trading_pnl["04-07-2019"] = 413
  print(trading_pnl)
  print()
  ```

* To modify an existing key-value pair within a dictionary, specify a new value for that particular key, as shown in the following example:

  ```python
  # Modify a key value
  trading_pnl["04-07-2019"] = 542
  print(trading_pnl)
  print()
  ```

* Use the `get()` method to access the value by specifying the key, as shown in the following example:

  ```python
  print(trading_pnl.get("03-29-2019"))
  print()
  ```

* Use the `del` keyword to delete a particular key within a dictionary, as follows:

  ```python
  # Delete a key-value pair
  del trading_pnl["04-07-2019"]
  print(trading_pnl)
  print()
  ```

Ask if there are any questions before students get the opportunity to practice with dictionaries.

### 14. Student Do: Working with Dictionaries (10 min)

In the following activity, students will practice working with dictionaries.

**Files:**

[Starter file](Activities/06_Stu_Working_with_Dictionaries/Unsolved/dictionaries.py)

[Instructions](Activities/06_Stu_Working_with_Dictionaries/README.md)

**Instructions:**

Using the starter code, manipulate the following dictionary based on the instructions provided:

```python
student_loan_information_aj = {
    'student_name': 'Amy Johnson',
    'university': 'Yale',
    'academic_year': '2015_2016',
    'loan_amount': 45000,
    'duration_years' : 10,
    'payments_started' : False
}
```

Follow these instructions to manipulate the dictionary:

* The student's name was spelled incorrectly. Update the value of the `student_name` key to `Amy Johnston`. Be sure to print the dictionary so that you know your changes are working.

  **Hint:** Remember bracket notation.

* Every loan should have an interest rate associated with its information. Add a key called `interest_rate` and assign it a value of 3.5% (or 0.035). Print the dictionary so that you know your changes are working.

* It appears that the key for `loan_amount` has been spelled incorrectly. Delete the existing key-value pair. Add a new key-value pair with the correct spelling. You can use the same amount of 45000. Print the dictionary so that you know your changes are working.

### 15. Instructor Do: Review Working with Dictionaries (10 min)

**File:**

[Solution file](Activities/06_Stu_Working_with_Dictionaries/Solved/dictionaries.py)

Review the dictionaries activity with the students.

In addition to reviewing the coded solution, engage students by asking them the following questions about dictionaries and how they contrast with lists:

* What syntax defines a dictionary?

  **Answer:** Curly brackets, key-value pairs, and commas between key-value elements

* How do you access a value in a dictionary? Contrast this to how you access a value from a list.

  **Answer:** You reference the key. For a list, you reference the index position.

* Are the elements in a dictionary ordered?

  **Answer:** No, key-value pairs aren't ordered like list elements. You must reference the key and not any type of position.

Answer any additional questions students have about dictionaries before moving on to the Question and Answer part of this session.

## Open Office Hours (Optional)

### Q&A and System Support

This is an opportunity to support students in any way that they require.

* Offer personalized support for students. (**Note:** Feel free to pair individual students off with instructional staff as needed.)

* Ensure that everyone's system is functional and that students can access VS Code as well as their terminal instance to run the Python files.

* Possible dev environment issues this week might involve Canvas, downloading the activity files, using VS Code, and running Python files with Terminal or GitBash.

* Students might also encounter file structure issues. Suggest keeping activity files in a `FinTech_Workspace` folder organized by module and lesson.
